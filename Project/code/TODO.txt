STEPS TODO PEDRO :

- AlTER de config.py to ypur project root but try to maintain the same logic and them add this file to the gitignore

- RUN the config.py file to create the intermediate and raw files as well as those inside of them

- ADD manually raw data into the raw folder from the project/raw path in the teacher's data (dont worry already added to the git ignore so no problems in commit)




TODO:
- Check the python files inside of the b-line detection folder analyse them to check any disruptions that need to be altered, DONE

- Fix the 5_get_processed_frames file, DONE

- Continue the github steps, use only the frame level classfication part
- Choose only the transformer models from the intermediate/models folder
- Choose more transformer models from hugging face is feasable (it is, just needs more search)
- Alter or add in the training runs a transformer based model
- Analyse the evaluation folder
- Obtain results 
- Write Paper
- Don't forget to cite the authors of the "Deep Learning for Detection and Localization of B-Lines in Lung Ultrasound" paper


14/05 and 15/05
- Did the steps in the github plus some exploration by myself, we dont need to run the steps 1 to 4 in the data preparation folder as the respective .pkl files are already generated and in the supplementary_files folder
and were after copied to the intermediate/annotation folder and intermediate/info folder

- There's a problem when running the 5_get_processed_frames file so i didnt generate the png images for each frame YET!!

- They have already in the frame level classfication tested some transformers models, maybe we will use those and add more to extend the test and results

- Added to the intermediate/models folder all of the frame level models that they trained
